API Penetration Testing Checklists

# Authentication and authorization:


Verify the strength of the authentication mechanisms used by the API, such as passwords, tokens, or API keys.

Check if the API uses secure transport protocols such as HTTPS.

Verify if the access controls are implemented correctly and if unauthorized access is restricted.

Ensure the API implements a proper password policy (i.e., password complexity, reset mechanism, etc.).

Verify if the API uses rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
